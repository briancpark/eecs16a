    "Multilateration is a technique sometimes used in positioning systems to precisely locate a receiver by measuring the time difference of arrivals (TDOAs) from several synchronized *Beacons* at one receiver location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have $n$ beacons $B_0$, $B_1$, ... $B_{n - 1}$, so the position of a beacon $B_m$ in the 2-D plane will be $B_m = (x_m, y_m)$. These positions are known. We also have a receiver $R$ with unknown position $(x, y)$ in the same plane. Let $R_m$ denote the distance of $B_m$ to $R$, $R_m = \\sqrt{(x - x_m)^2 + (y - y_m)^2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplification, in this lab we set the first beacon $B_0$ at position (0, 0), as a reference. We also let $\\tau_0$, $\\tau_1$ ... $\\tau_{n - 1}$ denote the TDOA's. Since we are referencing the first beacon, $\\tau_0$ is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from last week that we find the distances from speakers to the microphone with the arrival time of the first beacon $t_0$. However in a real application like GPS finding $t_0$ is impossible. Thus we are unable to get the exact distances from the speakers to the microphone. Instead of obtaining circles as we got last week, we are only able to get hyperbolic solutions, which is explained below. \n",
