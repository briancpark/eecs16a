    "Recall that in the last lab, you illuminated one pixel of the image at a time. This week, you'll flex your linear algebra skills and try something different. You will experiment with imaging methods that illuminate *multiple pixels* at a time. You'll find that if we design our masks in a clever way, our imaging system can be much more robust to noise than the single-pixel approach. You will generate a binary mask matrix that the virtual projector will use to illuminate multi-pixel patterns onto your image. Before scanning your custom images, you'll walk through a basic multi-pixel imaging simulation to understand how it works, delve deeper into the differences between ideal and non-ideal imaging, and understand why certain matrices are better than others at imaging in noisy systems.\n",
